# Algorithms

In this repo, I'll outline a few good algorithms/concepts to know, taken from some sources online. The main aim is to understand and be able to implement them when you have an idea using these algorithms.

### Logarithm

The logarithm is usually referenced in Big O notation, such as `O(log n)`. This is a significant time complexity reduction from `O(n)` as if a linear time function takes 40000 operations to complete, a logarithmic time function with `n = 40000` would only take around 15.28 operations to complete. 

### Graph Traversal

The next couple algorithms are used for efficient graph traversal. 

##### BFS

Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`
Data Structures: HashSet

Breadth first search traverses a graph, spreading out to all connected nodes before going down to the next layer.

##### DFS

Time Complexity:`O(V + E)`
Data Structures: HashSet

Depth first search traverses a graph, going as deep as possible first instead.

### Binary Search

Time Complexity: `O(log n)`

The binary search is an algorithm which uses half intervals in order to find an item in logarithmic time. 

### Double Pointer technique

Using two pointers, usually called the sliding window technique is a method where you manipulate two pointers at the same time, usually used to iterate through a list.

### Recursion

### Inversion (Binary Tree) and Reversion (Linked List)

### Suffix Tree

### Heaps (Min/Max)

### Dynamic Programming

### Sorting Algorithms

##### Quick Sort

Quick Select (Searching for k-th smallest or largest value)

##### Merge Sort
