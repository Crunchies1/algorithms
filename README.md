# Algorithms

In this repo, I'll outline a few good algorithms/concepts to know, taken from some sources online. The main aim is to understand and be able to implement them when you have an idea using these algorithms.

### Logarithm

### Graph Traversal

##### BFS

Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`
Data Structures: HashSet

##### DFS

Time Complexity:`O(V + E)`
Data Structures: HashSet

### Binary Search

### Double Pointer technique

### Recursion

### Inversion (Binary Tree) and Reversion (Linked List)

### Suffix Tree

### Heaps (Min/Max)

### Dynamic Programming

### Sorting Algorithms

##### Quick Sort

Quick Select (Searching for k-th smallest or largest value)

##### Merge Sort
